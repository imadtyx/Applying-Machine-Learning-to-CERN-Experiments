In this project I shall train a classifier to identify type of a particle. 
There are six particle types: electron, proton, muon, kaon, pion and ghost. 
Ghost is a particle with other type than the first five or a detector noise.
Different particle types remain different responses in the detector systems or subdetectors. 
Thre are five systems: tracking system, ring imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH), electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, 
and muon system. Particle type can be identified using the responses in the detector systems.
